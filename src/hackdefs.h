//		TODO: it would be nice if these were runtime-togglable instead of hardcoded defines
//		Agreed, I've been working out how auto-detection of games and rom version would work for some of these for a while.
//		For now it'd be enough to manually set those from menu. Will try.

//	#define SONICCAMHACK // enables camhack (see Sonic offscreen) in sonic games, and hitbox/solidity display
//	#define SONICSPEEDHACK // enables speed/position printout in sonic games
//	#define SONICMAPHACK // enables (not fully automatic) dumping of sonic level maps to bitmap
//	#define SONICROUTEHACK // enables semi-automatic dumping of sonic routes maps to bitmap
	#define SONICNOHITBOXES // disables hitbox display of SONICCAMHACK
	#define SONICNOSOLIDITYDISPLAY // disables solidity display of SONICCAMHACK
//	#define SK // specifies that the sonic game being used is Sonic 3-based (S3, SK, S3&K)

//	#define S1 // specifies that the sonic game being used is Sonic 1-based (S1, S1MM, S1MM_CD)
